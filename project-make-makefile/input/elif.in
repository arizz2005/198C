So.....
Turns out that there are ways to only affect one file.
As in a second file might not get processed.

That being the case,
we kind of need a second file in the given stuff for testing.

That way you can be more confident your Makefile hits all files.

So, uhhh, here you go.
Best of luck,
and congratulations,
you basically at the end of this class.
